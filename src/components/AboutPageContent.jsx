        ABOUT VAN VOYAGE - DRIVE THE DREAM
      </h1>
      <h2 className="font-mono pt-8 lg:pt-12 lg:text-xl">OUR STORY</h2>
      <p className="font-mono text-xs sm:text-sm md:text-md lg:text-md">
        Van Voyage was born from a passion for exploration and a deep respect
        for nature. Our founders, a team of avid travelers, and artisans, sought
        to create a unique and sustainable way for adventurers to explore the
        breathtaking landscapes of Australia. Thus, Van Voyage took shape,
        offering vintage camper-vans that not only provide comfort and luxury
        but also inspire a connection with the open road and the environment.
